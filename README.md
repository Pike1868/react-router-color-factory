# React Router and Testing Practice
## Overview
This project is a practice assignment designed to enhance skills in using React Router and testing React components. The primary focus is on building a color-themed application where users can view, add, and navigate between different colors.

## Features
- Color Viewing: Users can view a list of colors and select any color to see its details.
- Color Addition: A form is provided for users to add new colors to the list by specifying a color name and selecting a hex value.
- Dynamic Routing: The application uses React Router for navigation, with dynamic routes for each individual color.
- Error Handling: Non-existent routes are redirected to the main color list.
## Technical Aspects
- React Router: Implemented to manage routing between different views of the application.
- Component Structure: Organized component hierarchy to effectively handle state and props.
- State Management: Utilized React state to manage the list of colors and form data.
- Testing: Includes smoke and snapshot tests for components using React Testing Library and Jest.
